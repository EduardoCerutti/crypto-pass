    <h1>Privacy Policy – Crypto Pass</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 22/07/2025</p>

    <p>
      <strong>Crypto Pass</strong> is a utility application designed to help
      users generate deterministic, encrypted passwords based on a combination
      of a passphrase and a password input by the user. Your privacy is
      important to us, and we want to be transparent about how the app works and
      how your data is handled.
    </p>

    <h2>1. No Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
      Crypto Pass does <strong>not collect</strong>, <strong>store</strong>, or
      <strong>transmit</strong> any personal data or user input. All operations,
      including the encryption process, are performed locally on your device.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        No personal information (e.g., name, email, location, phone number) is
        collected.
      </li>
      <li>
        No usage analytics, tracking, or advertising identifiers are used.
      </li>
      <li>
        No data is stored on our servers — in fact,
        <strong>Crypto Pass does not connect to the internet</strong>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Local Encryption Only</h2>
    <p>
      All inputs entered into the app (passphrase and password) are used
      <strong>solely for local encryption</strong> and password generation on
      your device. Once you close the app or clear the input fields, the data is
      lost — nothing is saved.
    </p>

    <h2>3. No Third-Party Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      Crypto Pass does not share any information with third parties because no
      information is collected in the first place.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Security</h2>
    <p>
      The app uses a deterministic encryption algorithm to generate secure
      passwords based on user inputs. As all processing is done on-device, the
      security of your data remains fully under your control.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Contact</h2>
    <p>
      If you have any questions or concerns regarding this privacy policy, feel

    </p>

    <h2>6. Disclaimer on Password Recovery</h2>
    <p>
      Crypto Pass does not store any user input or generated passwords. All
      encryption and password generation is performed locally on the user’s
      device, and no data is retained once the app is closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As such, we are
      <strong>not responsible for any loss of access</strong> due to forgotten
      passphrases or passwords. Users are solely responsible for securely
      managing and remembering their own credentials.
